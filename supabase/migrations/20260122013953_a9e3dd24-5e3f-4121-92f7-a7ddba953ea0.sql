-- Fix: Convert RESTRICTIVE policies to PERMISSIVE on profiles table
-- RESTRICTIVE policies require ALL policies to pass, which can cause unexpected behavior
-- We drop and recreate them as PERMISSIVE policies

-- Drop existing RESTRICTIVE policies on profiles table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- Recreate as PERMISSIVE policies (default behavior, more intuitive)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
